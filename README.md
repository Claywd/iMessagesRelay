# iMessagesRelay
Uses iMessages, Mail, and contacts to allow users to respond to imessages over email. Requires a mac running.

Fair warning... I started this when I had a surface book and planned to implement my own windows 10 app and database for 
easy and efficient text messaging over imessages. 

I no longer have that windows device and personally, I don't plan to go back to an under developed OS. 
I'll hack macs and linux before I go back to Windows 10 and the surface line.
